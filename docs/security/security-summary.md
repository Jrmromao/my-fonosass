## 📊 **Current Security Status**

### **✅ Security Strengths**
- **Authentication**: Clerk integration properly implemented
- **Environment Variables**: Secrets stored securely
- **HTTPS**: TLS 1.2+ enforced
- **Database**: Prisma ORM provides SQL injection protection
- **File Storage**: Secure S3 implementation
- **Webhook Security**: Proper signature verification

### **🟡 Remaining Medium Priority Issues**
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: 29 vulnerabilities found (1 Critical, 8 Moderate, 20 Low)
- **File Upload Security**: Needs enhanced validation and scanning
- **Input Validation**: Some endpoints need stronger validation
- **Session Management**: Could be enhanced
- **CSRF Protection**: Needs implementation

## 🚨 **Immediate Action Required**

### **1. Update Dependencies (CRITICAL)**
```bash
# Update Next.js to fix security vulnerabilities
yarn add next@latest

# Update other vulnerable packages
yarn add form-data@latest nanoid@latest @babel/runtime@latest
```

### **2. Run Security Tests**
```bash
# Test current security status
yarn security:test

# Check for remaining vulnerabilities
yarn security:audit
```

---

## 📋 **Security Test Results**

### **✅ Passed Tests**
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials found
- ✅ No hardcoded emails found  
- ✅ No sensitive data in console logs
- ✅ Security headers implemented
- ✅ Authentication on all API routes
- ✅ Rate limiting active

### **⚠️ Dependency Vulnerabilities Found**
- **1 Critical**: form-data unsafe random function
- **8 Moderate**: Next.js, nanoid, @babel/runtime issues
- **20 Low**: Various minor vulnerabilities

## 🛡️ **Security Measures Implemented**

### **1. Security Headers**
```typescript
// All pages now have these headers:
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: [Comprehensive CSP]
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### **2. Rate Limiting**
- **100 requests per 15 minutes** per IP
- **Automatic blocking** of excessive requests
- **Rate limit headers** in responses

### **3. Authentication**
- **All API routes** require authentication
- **Proper error handling** for unauthorized access
- **Secure user validation** throughout

### **4. Input Validation**
- **Zod schemas** for data validation
- **Length limits** on text inputs
- **Type checking** for all inputs
