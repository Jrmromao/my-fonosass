## Key Test Scenarios

### 1. Mobile Environment Detection
- ✅ Correctly detects mobile devices using `'ontouchstart' in window`
- ✅ Correctly detects mobile devices using `navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0`

### 2. Touch Event Handling
- ✅ Creates and handles TouchEvent objects correctly
- ✅ Extracts touch coordinates (clientX, clientY) properly
- ✅ Handles multiple touch points

### 3. Double-Tap Timing Logic
- ✅ Detects double-tap within 300ms window
- ✅ Distinguishes between single-tap and double-tap
- ✅ Uses consistent timing across mobile and desktop

### 4. Hit Radius Calculations
- ✅ Mobile: 80px base hit radius (larger for easier touch)
- ✅ Desktop: 50px base hit radius (more precise)
- ✅ Scales correctly with balloon size

### 5. Coordinate Scaling
- ✅ Handles device pixel ratio scaling (2x on high-DPI displays)
- ✅ Correctly scales canvas dimensions vs display dimensions
- ✅ Maintains coordinate accuracy across different screen densities

### 6. Problematic Area Detection
- ✅ Correctly identifies top-right corner area (x > 300, y < 150)
- ✅ Enables targeted debugging for specific problem zones

### 7. Balloon Overlap Detection
- ✅ Calculates distance between balloons correctly
- ✅ Uses 60% separation rule to prevent overlap
- ✅ Handles mobile-optimized sizing (40px base vs 35px desktop)

### 8. Rapid Touch Events
- ✅ Handles multiple rapid touch events without errors
- ✅ Maintains performance with 5+ simultaneous touches
- ✅ Preserves coordinate accuracy under load

### 9. Canvas Dimensions
- ✅ Correctly sets canvas width/height with DPR scaling
- ✅ Maintains aspect ratio across different screen sizes
- ✅ Handles both logical and physical pixel dimensions

## Mobile-Specific Optimizations Verified

### Touch Interaction Improvements
- **Larger Hit Radius**: 80px on mobile vs 50px on desktop
- **Double-Tap to Pop**: Consistent behavior across platforms
- **Coordinate Scaling**: Proper handling of device pixel ratio
- **Touch Event Support**: Full touch event lifecycle handling

### Problematic Area Fixes
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Targeted logging for top-right corner
- **Coordinate Adjustment**: Mobile viewport scaling compensation
- **Larger Touch Targets**: 60% larger hit areas for easier interaction

## Performance Optimizations Tested

### Canvas Rendering
- ✅ Proper canvas initialization with DPR scaling
- ✅ Efficient coordinate transformation
- ✅ Memory-efficient touch event handling

### Touch Event Processing
- ✅ Rapid event handling without performance degradation
- ✅ Efficient coordinate calculations
- ✅ Minimal memory allocation during touch interactions

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- ✅ Handles missing canvas context
- ✅ Manages touch events without canvas
- ✅ Provides fallbacks for unsupported features

### Edge Cases
- ✅ Handles rapid touch sequences
- ✅ Manages coordinate scaling edge cases
- ✅ Handles canvas resize scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Touch Events Not Working**: Check mobile detection logic
- **Coordinate Mismatches**: Verify DPR scaling calculations
- **Hit Detection Failures**: Confirm hit radius calculations
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor rapid event handling

### Debug Information
The tests include comprehensive logging for:
- Mobile vs desktop detection
- Touch event coordinates
